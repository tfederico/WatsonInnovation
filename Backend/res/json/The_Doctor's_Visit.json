The doctor visiting her is having his glass filled by the maid. The girl is probably suffering from a \u2018wandering womb\u2019, an illness that mainly affected young virgins. Although the condition was taken very seriously by doctors in those days, Steen sees the comical side of it. The dogs on the staircase show the remedy for the ailment \u2013 the girl must find a husband as soon as possible."}
