He is strikingly dressed in a feathered beret and a cloak with gold embroidery. The light is falling brightly on his face and casting a beautiful sheen on his metal gorget. The painting is not a portrait, but a \u2018tronie\u2019, or character sketch. In this case, it is of a soldier, who is dressed in an old-fashioned style. Rembrandt did not sign the painting RHL (Rembrandt Harmenszoon Leydensis), as he had done for a long time before that, but with his first name alone."}
