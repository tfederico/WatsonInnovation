It is not a portrait, but a \u2018tronie\u2019 \u2013 a painting of an imaginary figure. Tronies depict a certain type or character; in this case a girl in exotic dress, wearing an oriental turban and an improbably large pearl in her ear. Johannes Vermeer was the master of light. This is shown here in the softness of the girl\u2019s face and the glimmers of light on her moist lips. And of course, the shining pearl."}
