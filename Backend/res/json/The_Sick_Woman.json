Is she perhaps lovesick? Is she pregnant? To find out, a quack would put a strip of his patient\u2019s clothing in a brazier to smoulder \u2013 the scent would disclose her secret. Jan Steen here presents such a charlatan making a diagnosis. His old-fashioned attire characterizes him as a comic character."}
