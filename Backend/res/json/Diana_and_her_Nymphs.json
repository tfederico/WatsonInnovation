{"description": "Vermeer is best known for his small paintings of tranquil interiors with a few figures. But early on in his career, he painted a few larger biblical and mythological scenes, including this one. The goddess Diana is taking a rest with her nymphs. She is the goddess of hunting and of the night, which explains the hound at her feet and the moon on her forehead. The dreamy atmosphere of the scene is typical of Vermeer\u2019s work.", "museum": "Mauritshuis", "null": ["rest feet vermeer career tranquil interiors figures night forehead nymphs hound small paintings mythological scenes goddess diana dreamy atmosphere hunting"], "thumbnailURL": "https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0406_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE", "author": "Johannes Vermeer", "id": "Diana_and_her_Nymphs", "painting": "Diana and her Nymphs"}
