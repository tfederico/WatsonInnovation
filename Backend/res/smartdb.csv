Portrait_of_a_Woman_Possibly_Maria_Trip	Portrait of a Woman, Possibly Maria Trip	Rembrandt van Rijn	The young sitter is assumed to be Maria Trip, the daughter of a wealthy Amsterdam merchant. She displaysher wealth with pride. Her dress is trimmed with white linen so fine it is almost transparent. She sports a fortune in pearls, and in her left hand she casually holds the knobbed handle of a folding fan. In 1639 thiswas still a rare and costly accessory.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-C-597&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	white linen dress fortune maria trip pearls pride costly accessory wealthy amsterdam merchant daughter left hand folding fan young sitter
Young_Woman_in_Fantasy_Costume	Young Woman in Fantasy Costume	Rembrandt van Rijn	The young woman’s clothing is not in keeping with the fashions of Rembrandt’s day, but rather reflects styles of earlier centuries. The woman’s distinctive features – a domed forehead, slightly bulging eyes, andpronounced chin – are easily recognized in depictions of ancient goddesses and heroines that Rembrandtpainted in the 1630s. Thus the painting is not strictly a portrait, but a ‘tronie’, or fantasy head.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-A-4057&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	chin fashions heroines young woman portrait eyes earlier centuries depictions ancient goddesses painting distinctive features fantasy head domed forehead 1630s clothing styles rembrandt
Landscape_with_a_Stone_Bridge	Landscape with a Stone Bridge	Rembrandt van Rijn	Rembrandt painted only a few landscapes, mostly imaginary mountain scenes. Although The Stone Bridgeis composed of elements studied from reality, it probably does not represent a specific place. The painting’smagical quality derives from its dramatic illumination: a beam of sunlight breaks through the clouds, makingthe approaching storm seem twice as menacing.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-A-1935&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	landscapes beam specific place storm dramatic illumination stone bridge clouds imaginary mountain scenes magical quality painting sunlight breaks reality rembrandt
The_Wardens_of_the_Amsterdam_Drapers’_Guild_Known_as_‘The_Syndics’	The Wardens of the Amsterdam Drapers’ Guild, Known as ‘The Syndics’	Rembrandt van Rijn	The syndics inspected the quality of dyed cloth. Rembrandt portrayed them looking up from their work, as though disturbed by our arrival. This artistic device was a clever way of enlivening the scene and thereby involving the viewer. This late work by Rembrandt not only attests to his endless creativity, but also to his undiminished popularity among the citizens of Amsterdam.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-C-6&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	undiminished popularity arrival artistic device quality scene amsterdam syndics late work clever way citizens endless creativity rembrandt cloth
The_Milkmaid	The Milkmaid	Johannes Vermeer	A maidservant pours milk, entirely absorbed in her work. Except for the stream of milk, everything else is still. Vermeer took this simple everyday activity and made it the subject of an impressive painting – the woman stands like a statue in the brightly lit room. Vermeer also had an eye for how light by means of hundreds of colourful dots plays over the surface of objects.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-A-2344&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	colourful dots simple everyday activity vermeer maidservant pours milk impressive painting statue brightly lit room
Woman_Reading_a_letter	Woman Reading a letter	Johannes Vermeer	Enjoying a quiet, private moment, this young woman is absorbed in reading a letter in the morning light. She is still wearing her blue night jacket. All of the colours in the composition are secondary to its radiant lapis lazuli blue. Vermeer recorded the effects of light with extraordinary precision. Particularly innovative is his rendering of the woman’s skin with pale grey, and the shadows on the wall using light blue.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-C-251&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	radiant lapis vermeer pale grey skin rendering young woman extraordinary precision blue night jacket private moment effects morning light composition letter shadows colours
View_of_Houses_in_Delft_Known_as_‘The_Little_Street’_	View of Houses in Delft, Known as ‘The Little Street’ 	Johannes Vermeer	This painting of a quiet street with a few figures occupies an exceptional place in Vermeer’s oeuvre. Straightangles give the composition balance, while the triangle of the sky introduces a sense of dynamism. The oldwalls, coarse bricks, and white plasterwork are almost palpable. Vermeer nonetheless took some libertieswith reality, such as the oversized green shutters.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-A-2860&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	vermeer composition balance angles figures liberties exceptional place sense white plasterwork triangle walls painting oversized green shutters dynamism reality quiet street coarse bricks
The_Merry_Family	The Merry Family	Jan Havicksz Steen	This boisterous family is making a lot of noise: the father sings at the top of his lungs while raising a glass; the mother and grandmother chime in; and the children are either blowing into a wind instrument or smoking a long pipe. The note hanging from the mantelpiece gives away the moral of the story: ‘As the old sing, so shall the young twitter.’ What will become of the children if their parents set the wrong example?	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-C-229&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	note glass grandmother chime young twitter. father old sing mantelpiece moral wind instrument children wrong example noise boisterous family lungs long pipe story
The_Sick_Woman	The Sick Woman	Jan Havicksz Steen	Faint from fever, the young woman rests her head on a pillow. Is she perhaps lovesick? Is she pregnant? To find out, a quack would put a strip of his patient’s clothing in a brazier to smoulder – the scent would disclose her secret. Jan Steen here presents such a charlatan making a diagnosis. His old-fashioned attire characterizes him as a comic character.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-C-230&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	comic character charlatan fever quack secret young woman jan steen head strip patient’s clothing brazier pillow scent old-fashioned attire
Woman_at_her_Toilet	Woman at her Toilet	Jan Havicksz Steen	This is an intimate moment – a girl undressing before going to bed. She is just pulling off a stocking. Theindentation left by her garter is visible just below her knee. Her raised skirt allows the viewer a peak up along her bare legs. The image’s explicit eroticism did not always find favour; until a hundred years ago, an underskirt was painted over her thighs.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fassetimage2.jsp%3Fid%3DSK-A-4052&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Rijksmuseum	thighs image viewer stocking garter explicit eroticism bare legs intimate moment peak girl favour knee indentation skirt
The_Anatomy_Lesson_of_Dr_Nicolaes_Tulp	The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp	Rembrandt van Rijn	Rembrandt was only twenty-five when he was asked to paint the portraits of the Amsterdam surgeons. The portrait was commissioned for the anatomy lesson given by Dr Nicolaes Tulp in January 1632. Rembrandt portrayed the surgeons in action, and they are all looking at different things. Dynamism is added to the scene by the great contrasts between light and dark. In this group portrait, the young painter displayed his legendary technique and his great talent for painting lifelike portraits.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F146_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	dr nicolaes tulp different things scene young painter legendary technique group portrait anatomy lesson great contrasts painting lifelike portraits action great talent amsterdam surgeons rembrandt dynamism
Suzanna	Suzanna	Rembrandt van Rijn	Susanna is just about to bathe, when two old men appear from the bushes. She is looking up in alarm –the men behind her on the right are hardly visible in the dark. They try to force Susanna to have sex with them, threatening to spread slander about her. Rembrandt portrayed Susanna in full light, which makes her appear even more vulnerable in her nakedness. He did not paint an idealised woman, but one of flesh and blood. You can still see the impression left on her calves by her stockings.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0147_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	sex slander right nakedness old men calves light bushes alarm dark stockings impression flesh idealised woman susanna rembrandt
'Tronie'_of_a_Man_with_a_Feathered_Beret	'Tronie' of a Man with a Feathered Beret	Rembrandt van Rijn	A man twists his head to the right and looks at us over his shoulder. He is strikingly dressed in a feathered beret and a cloak with gold embroidery. The light is falling brightly on his face and casting a beautiful sheen on his metal gorget. The painting is not a portrait, but a ‘tronie’, or character sketch. In this case, it is of a soldier, who is dressed in an old-fashioned style. Rembrandt did not sign the painting RHL (Rembrandt Harmenszoon Leydensis), as he had done for a long time before that, but with his first name alone.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0149_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	old-fashioned style beret metal gorget right portrait rembrandt harmenszoon leydensis beautiful sheen gold embroidery head face painting rhl cloak soldier light character sketch long time man shoulder
Girl_with_Pearl_Earring	Girl with Pearl Earring	Johannes Vermeer	Girl with a Pearl Earring is Vermeer’s most famous painting. It is not a portrait, but a ‘tronie’ – a painting of an imaginary figure. Tronies depict a certain type or character; in this case a girl in exotic dress, wearing an oriental turban and an improbably large pearl in her ear. Johannes Vermeer was the master of light. This is shown here in the softness of the girl’s face and the glimmers of light on her moist lips. And of course, the shining pearl.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0670_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	imaginary figure certain type girl portrait face character exotic dress pearl earring painting moist lips tronies course improbably large pearl johannes vermeer glimmers ‘tronie oriental turban softness case
View_of_Delft	View of Delft	Johannes Vermeer	This is the most famous cityscape of the Dutch Golden Age. The interplay of light and shade, the impressive cloudy sky and the subtle reflections in the water make this painting an absolute masterpiece. We are looking at Delft from the south. There is hardly a breath of wind and the city has an air of tranquillity. Vermeer reflected this tranquillity in his composition, by making three horizontal strips: water, city and sky. He also painted the buildings a bit neater than they actually were.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0092_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	dutch golden age vermeer south impressive cloudy sky subtle reflections absolute masterpiece interplay famous cityscape horizontal strips bit water breath delft tranquillity composition painting buildings wind
Diana_and_her_Nymphs	Diana and her Nymphs	Johannes Vermeer	Vermeer is best known for his small paintings of tranquil interiors with a few figures. But early on in his career, he painted a few larger biblical and mythological scenes, including this one. The goddess Diana is taking a rest with her nymphs. She is the goddess of hunting and of the night, which explains the hound at her feet and the moon on her forehead. The dreamy atmosphere of the scene is typical of Vermeer’s work.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0406_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	rest feet vermeer career tranquil interiors figures night forehead nymphs hound small paintings mythological scenes goddess diana dreamy atmosphere hunting
'As_the_Old_Sing_So_Pipe_the_Young'	'As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young'	Jan Havicksz Steen	Here, Steen has depicted the proverb ‘As the old sing, so pipe the young’, meaning that a bad example leads to bad conduct. The woman on the left with the open cleavage is having her glass topped up. On the right, the laughing father is teaching one of his children to smoke a pipe. This is Steen himself. Besides his gift for telling humorous stories, Steen was also a skilled painter who could suggest a variety of materials, such as the earthenware jug on the floor, the lilac skirt and the sparkling wine.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0742_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	earthenware jug glass woman sparkling wine old sing bad example steen humorous stories lilac skirt bad conduct open cleavage proverb laughing father skilled painter
The_Sick_Girl	The Sick Girl	Jan Havicksz Steen	One of Jan Steen’s favourite subjects was the doctor’s visit, or the sick girl. It is a humorous theme that was perfectly suited to Steen’s style. A languishing young girl is being examined by the doctor. He is being fooled, as the girl is pretending to suffer from a ‘wandering womb’, a condition that was taken very seriously by doctors in those days. The only remedy was for the patient to sleep with her lover. And that is exactly what this girl intends to do.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0167_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	favourite subjects lover remedy jan steen doctor sick girl condition young girl doctors steen’s style womb visit humorous theme
The_Doctor's_Visit	The Doctor's Visit	Jan Havicksz Steen	A sick girl lies in bed, propped up by pillows. The doctor visiting her is having his glass filled by the maid. The girl is probably suffering from a ‘wandering womb’, an illness that mainly affected young virgins. Although the condition was taken very seriously by doctors in those days, Steen sees the comical side of it. The dogs on the staircase show the remedy for the ailment – the girl must find a husband as soon as possible.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0168_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	bed glass young virgins steen remedy husband ailment doctor sick girl condition doctors pillows womb maid staircase illness
Girl_Eating_Oysters	Girl Eating Oysters	Jan Havicksz Steen	Jan Steen’s paintings often have a touch of eroticism. Here, a young woman is looking at us coquettishly while preparing an oyster. Oysters were known as an aphrodisiac, and this girl seems to be offering more than just good food. This small painting is meant to be studied close up. So Steen painted it very precisely and in great detail. Take the silver tray with bread and salt, for example. Or the fashionable jacket with fur and velvet – you can almost stroke it.	https://www.europeana.eu/api/v2/thumbnail-by-url.json?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffileshare.mauritshuis.nl%2Fcollectie%2F0818_repro.jpg&size=LARGE&type=IMAGE	Mauritshuis	aphrodisiac bread fur salt touch oysters young woman small painting jan steen example fashionable jacket oyster silver tray velvet eroticism paintings good food
